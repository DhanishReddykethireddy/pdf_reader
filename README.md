# pdf_reader
This Python script reads text from a PDF file using PyPDF2 and converts the extracted text into speech with gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). It processes all pages, concatenates their content, and saves the spoken output as an MP3 file. The program also handles errors and notifies if no text is found in the PDF.
